While the soccer world focuses on the opening game of the World Cup in Qatar on Sunday, Russia will be playing a friendly game in Uzbekistan. Russia was kicked out of World Cup qualifying after it invaded Ukraine and now can only play friendlies against the few nations prepared to accept its invitations. The Russian men's national team's only game of 2022 so far was a 2-1 win over Kyrgyzstan in September. Russian clubs are barred from the Champions League and the women's national team was removed from the European Championship.",

Since the start of the war in February it has lost perhaps 80,000 men, killed and wounded. The only provincial capital it has managed to take is Kherson city, captured in the first week of war and illegally annexed in September. And now that, too, seems to be slipping from its grasp. On November 9th Sergei Shoigu, Russia's defence minister, and General Sergei Surovikin, appointed as the commander of Russian forces in Ukraine weeks earlier, met Russian commanders and acknowledged that Russia's position in Kherson had become untenable.",

GUR points to desperate moves from Russia to extend its arsenal of weapons. While supplies have been running low, Russia has reached out to Iran in the hopes of being able to gain access to a full supply of ballistic missiles. Ukrainian intelligence officials have estimated that Russia has used at least 80% of its arsenal of missiles to attack crucial infrastructure within Ukraine.",

On November 9th Sergei Shoigu, Russia's defence minister, and General Sergei Surovikin, appointed as the commander of Russian forces in Ukraine weeks earlier, met Russian commanders and acknowledged that Russia's position in Kherson had become untenable.",

It will save thousands of lives.'Speaking in Ukrainian to the single most influential audience he has addressed since the war started, Mr Zelenskiy tried to pitch himself as a man prepared to reach an agreement with Russia, but only on terms that protected Ukrainian sovereignty.",
